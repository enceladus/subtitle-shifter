1
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,879
SUGAR CANE ALLEY

2
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,796
Dedicated to the world's
Black Shack Alleys.

3
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,568
Governorate of Martinique,
Rivière-Salée. August 1930...

4
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:03,701
It was school vacation time.

5
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:05,778
The children on
Black Shack Alley

6
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:07,677
waited impatiently

7
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:09,807
for their parents to go
to work in the cane fields

8
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:12,920
so they'd be left free
for the day.

9
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,016
Jose...

10
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,627
See how neat the shack is.

11
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:22,354
Your clothes are clean.

12
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:25,466
Don't give me reason to be mad
when I get back!

13
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:35,142
Good morning, Amantine.

14
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:38,477
Hurry, Twelve-toes!

15
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:40,478
Were you with the zombies
last night?

16
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:43,209
Yes, I was on Madame Dede.

17
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,909
They've gone!

18
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:47,180
Come, they've gone.

19
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:59,992
Hurry! You'll miss
the fight!

20
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:03,298
If the mongoose wins,
give me your watch.

21
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:06,407
You're crazy!
Carmen gave it to me.

22
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:22,422
I won. Give me your watch.

23
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:25,526
Miss, I didn't bet with you!

24
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,154
Liar! Give me your watch.

25
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:57,483
You only have bananas?

26
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,685
You don't even have
codfish!

27
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:04,060
Last night we ate
fruitbread and pork.

28
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,064
It was so very good!

29
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:08,226
So very good.

30
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,598
What's Gesner doing?

31
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:12,332
Hurry, Gesner,
we're eating at Jose's.

32
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:13,702
Let's eat outside.

33
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:16,902
I have flour and codfish.
But we eat outside.

34
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:22,145
Stop showing off.
Let us in.

35
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:27,083
I said we're eating outside.

36
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:29,588
Quiet!
There's the overseer!

37
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:32,215
The overseer!

38
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:47,131
He's gone.

39
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,651
Where's the sugar?

40
00:04:58,787 --> 00:04:59,981
There's none.

41
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:01,383
Look for it.

42
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,252
I said there's no sugar.

43
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:05,859
You're sure your grandma
didn't hide it?

44
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:07,518
It's all gone.

45
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,631
Too bad! I'll look
for it anyway.

46
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:13,961
I told you, there's no sugar!

47
00:05:14,102 --> 00:05:16,593
She must hide it!

48
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:21,869
If it's in Jesus' robes,
I'll find it!

49
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,875
If you think
it's in Jesus' robes,

50
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:25,570
then search in Heaven,
not here!

51
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:28,147
The sugar's all gone.

52
00:05:28,283 --> 00:05:30,615
You look in the boxes.
I'll check the bedroom.

53
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:32,811
I'll come with you.

54
00:05:32,954 --> 00:05:34,182
Don't you understand?

55
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:36,187
There's no more sugar!

56
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:37,586
I'll look under the bed.

57
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:39,488
Yes.

58
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:40,651
Nothing!

59
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:43,161
Look on the beams.

60
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:44,663
My ma hides it there.

61
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:47,927
I know! In the chamber pot!

62
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:51,333
Jose!

63
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:52,838
You're crazy!

64
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:54,771
Take off those shoes!

65
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,400
Gesner, you're a liar!
You broke the bowl!

66
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:59,410
Ma Tine's bowl!

67
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:03,108
Liar! You did it!

68
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:14,827
Just say a hen did it!

69
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:16,624
Twelve-Toes' hen.

70
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:19,631
She climbed on the table
and knocked down the bowl.

71
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,065
Julien Twelve-Toes'
frizzy hen!

72
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:24,330
Scared that Ma Tine
will beat you?

73
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:26,406
You need a charm.

74
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,406
No, a chant is better.

75
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:31,444
3 dogs, 3 cats, don't let
Ma Tine beat Jose!

76
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:35,743
No. A charm is better.
It'll save you.

77
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:38,114
No sugar!
So let's eat the flour!

78
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:40,847
You pig!

79
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:58,402
We'll make a grass charm,
so Ma Tine won't beat him.

80
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,208
3 knots in a blade of grass,
you'll be saved.

81
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:13,178
Hold it tight!

82
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:16,552
When your grandma arrives,
toss it behind you.

83
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:21,219
She'll scream and swear,
but she won't beat you.

84
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:44,538
Don't stare at adults.
It's rude.

85
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:52,911
Amantine, I see you're
enjoying your pipe!

86
00:08:55,657 --> 00:09:00,685
If I were alone I wouldn't
light the fire tonight.

87
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:05,822
I'd put a pinch of salt
on my tongue.

88
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:09,403
To keep the worms
from attacking my heart.

89
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:13,496
Then I'd go to bed
because I'm tired.

90
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:16,735
Tired like an old mule.

91
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,056
What does that say?

92
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:41,000
"Splendor and development
of the bust."

93
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:45,128
"Rebuild your bosom
with oriental pills."

94
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:48,436
"Develop firm breasts."

95
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:52,012
"No more protruding bones."

96
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:56,014
"Give graceful curves
to your bosom."

97
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:09,327
A well-brought up child
uses a spoon.

98
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:12,425
You broke my bowl!

99
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:15,866
And you had the nerve
to glue it!

100
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:18,096
You thought
I wouldn't notice?

101
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,938
The only thing
your dead mother left me!

102
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:26,205
Little scoundrel!

103
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,383
What were you looking for
in my things?

104
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:38,255
Get on your knees!

105
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:02,972
Ma Tine or not,
work faster!

106
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:05,517
Do your work properly!

107
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:08,622
The bundles must be thicker
and the cane is too short.

108
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:10,951
Do your work properly!

109
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:13,253
Make thicker bundles!

110
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:15,954
Ti Coco!
No pissing on work time!

111
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:18,190
Fine him 15 cents!
- Yes, boss.

112
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:20,027
Whitey's in his easy chair

113
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:22,568
Black man burns in the sun

114
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:24,398
Ti Coco pisses

115
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,007
Bossman comes along

116
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:41,822
Work!

117
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:14,951
Every day I'd go see Carmen.

118
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,890
He worked on the river boat
that went to Fort-de France.

119
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:22,427
Fort-de-France...

120
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:26,329
The city that all the village
children dream about...

121
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:44,077
It's you, Jose.

122
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:54,852
Isn't she cute?

123
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:56,691
And the one yesterday?

124
00:12:56,831 --> 00:13:00,028
It's not my fault!
Girls won't leave me alone.

125
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,101
Now, the serious stuff.

126
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:04,397
All right.

127
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:14,209
The "H" is good,
so is the "L".

128
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:18,216
Your "O" is too fat.

129
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:20,980
Your "U" is dancing
the beguine!

130
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:25,718
Is it really dancing
the beguine?

131
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,387
Do it over.

132
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:57,048
A riddle!

133
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:59,125
I'm ready.

134
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,990
Whenever you see her,
she's pregnant.

135
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:07,066
But she never gives birth.

136
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:09,226
The full moon.

137
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:12,637
Another riddle!

138
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:15,264
I'm ready.

139
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:19,607
Guess it and I'll give you
a white blackbird.

140
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:26,413
Little black boy, dressed
in white, in a green castle.

141
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:28,647
Medouze, the cutter!

142
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:37,292
Ti Coco!

143
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,233
12 francs minus 10 cents.

144
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:47,200
A custard apple!

145
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:49,104
Cane doesn't need
your fertilizer!

146
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:51,040
Listen to that!

147
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:53,738
You're always pissing!

148
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:55,508
If you're sick
go see a doctor!

149
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:58,277
He's not sick, just lazy!

150
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:04,585
If my kidneys burst
I still have to hold it in!

151
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:07,785
Take your money and scram!

152
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:11,591
Amantine, the Grandma!

153
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:18,163
Julien Twelve-Toes!

154
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:32,716
Is that all?

155
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,218
What did you expect?

156
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:35,413
You got your due!

157
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:37,956
He broke his back!
That's all you give him?

158
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:39,457
Madame, 18 francs.

159
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:42,153
He couldn't do
that many rows in 5 days.

160
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:44,764
If it was too much,
he should've refused it.

161
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,958
You women always
talk nonsense!

162
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,830
Could anyone else
cut more cane than that?

163
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:49,958
Next!

164
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:51,332
Anastasie-Big-Belly!

165
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:52,734
Next!

166
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:54,340
Don't waste your saliva!

167
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:57,501
When you die, Whitey will stick
our money up your ass!

168
00:15:57,645 --> 00:16:00,876
God damn it! All my money
went to the shop!

169
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:05,577
What can I do with no money?
It's time I died!

170
00:16:10,357 --> 00:16:13,121
45 francs.

171
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:29,975
That's not enough.
You're short 6.50.

172
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,102
Put it on today's tab.

173
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:34,976
All right. On today's tab.

174
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,448
Give me 2 pig's tails...

175
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:41,550
Half a pot of flour...

176
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:47,661
And sliver of butter.

177
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:39,239
Is it you, child?

178
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:43,783
I'm not asleep, you know?

179
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:46,716
Just resting my old body.

180
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,320
Damn cane fields!

181
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:55,819
And cric!

182
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:56,923
And crac!

183
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,024
Are stories...

184
00:18:58,158 --> 00:18:59,785
...worth telling? Yes!
They are!

185
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:00,916
And cric!

186
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,222
And crac!

187
00:19:07,534 --> 00:19:10,196
Once upon a time...

188
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:11,964
...in Martinique...

189
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:14,472
there was a sad
and ugly old black man.

190
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:18,635
A liar would say,
"ugly as Jose."

191
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,714
But I'm not a liar, so...

192
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:25,842
...I’d say ugly as Medouze.

193
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:31,322
Everyday, the old man
spoke of his country.

194
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,891
Cric!

195
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:34,153
Crac!

196
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:35,353
Misticric!

197
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:37,293
Misticrac!

198
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:48,802
That country was called...

199
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:51,968
...Africa.

200
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:54,945
My dad's country.

201
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:58,210
The country of
your father's father.

202
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,655
The old black...

203
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:05,850
Sad and ugly...

204
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:09,224
Who had cried during
all his youth...

205
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:12,560
...would always say to me...

206
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,034
"Medouze, your old father
will die soon,"

207
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:20,140
"without ever understanding
what happened..."

208
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:24,335
"when the whites
landed here."

209
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:28,812
The old black also added:

210
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:31,042
"I had a big brother,
Ousmane,"

211
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:33,278
a little sister, Sokhna."

212
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,116
"The white men hunted us."

213
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:38,816
"They caught us
with lassos."

214
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:45,626
"Then... after many days,
journey through the bush,"

215
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,633
"They took us to the edge
of the big water."

216
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:53,297
"One day, we were
unloaded here."

217
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,173
"We were sold to cut cane
for the whites."

218
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:06,009
"I was a young boy like you,
Medouze."

219
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:10,783
"All the blacks came down
from the hills with sticks,"

220
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:14,223
"machetes, guns and torches."

221
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:17,728
"They invaded the town
of St. Pierre."

222
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:21,961
"They burned all the homes."

223
00:21:22,102 --> 00:21:26,903
"For the first time, blacks saw
whites shake with fear,"

224
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,941
"lock themselves
in their mansions and die."

225
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:33,535
"That was how slavery ended."

226
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:39,816
And the old black man said...

227
00:21:39,953 --> 00:21:42,820
"I ran so much..."

228
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:46,187
I think I ran all around
Martinique."

229
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:49,762
"When my feet refused
to go on"

230
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:53,060
"I looked ahead and behind."

231
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,761
"I saw I was back
in Black Shack Alley again."

232
00:21:56,904 --> 00:22:02,137
"It was back
to the cane fields."

233
00:22:02,276 --> 00:22:08,078
"We were free, but our bellies
were empty."

234
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:10,877
"The Master had become
the Boss!"

235
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:14,886
"So I stayed on, like all
the other blacks"

236
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:17,513
in this cursed country."

237
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:21,321
That's how my old Papa spoke.

238
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:28,861
Nothing has changed, son.

239
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:31,903
The whites own all the land.

240
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,837
The law forbids
their beating us,

241
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:38,809
but it doesn't force them
to pay us a decent wage.

242
00:22:43,283 --> 00:22:46,810
If you went to Africa,
Mr. Medouze...

243
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:51,922
I'd go with you.

244
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:59,960
Alas, my child...

245
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:08,170
Medouze will never go
to Africa.

246
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:13,541
Medouze has no one left
in Africa.

247
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:21,177
When I will be dead...

248
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:24,256
when my old body
is buried...

249
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:27,485
then I'll go to Africa.

250
00:23:27,628 --> 00:23:32,361
But I can't take you along.

251
00:23:57,691 --> 00:24:00,990
We'll all go back to Africa,
one day.

252
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:03,858
Don't you worry.

253
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:05,863
I don't like Twelve-Toes.

254
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:09,695
He keeps all his fruit
for himself.

255
00:24:09,836 --> 00:24:11,861
He planted...

256
00:24:12,005 --> 00:24:13,870
broken bottles all around.

257
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:15,031
Once...

258
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:16,870
he came after me
like a devil.

259
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,173
Careful...

260
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:22,578
He wants to hurt us!

261
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:25,116
Break it down.

262
00:24:28,622 --> 00:24:30,419
Come on!

263
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:32,024
Not me!

264
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,889
Me, neither!

265
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:40,324
A hen's egg!

266
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:41,593
Look!

267
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:43,327
An egg!

268
00:24:46,873 --> 00:24:50,741
It's pretty!

269
00:24:50,877 --> 00:24:52,504
Do we eat it?

270
00:24:52,646 --> 00:24:54,238
We'll cook it.

271
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,906
We'll taste an egg!

272
00:24:58,285 --> 00:24:59,775
I want the biggest piece.

273
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,148
We need matches.

274
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:02,482
There aren't any.

275
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:04,020
The store has some.

276
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,455
But I'll take guts
to get some.

277
00:25:06,593 --> 00:25:07,890
We have no money!

278
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:09,962
Say our ma wants them...
on credit.

279
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,621
Not me!

280
00:25:11,765 --> 00:25:12,663
Victorine, you go!

281
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,130
Me? Victorine?
No!

282
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:15,996
You know how to show off
in front of boys...

283
00:25:16,136 --> 00:25:17,660
...but you don't dare go
to the store?

284
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:20,602
You're silly.
You go, Orelie.

285
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:24,643
If you don't, you won't
even get a sliver of egg!

286
00:25:25,712 --> 00:25:28,237
Jose, get me a bottle.

287
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:30,009
What for?

288
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,310
You'll see.

289
00:25:31,451 --> 00:25:33,316
Tell me.

290
00:25:33,453 --> 00:25:37,184
What'll you do with it?

291
00:25:37,324 --> 00:25:40,725
Something silly,
and Dad will beat us tonight.

292
00:25:40,861 --> 00:25:42,726
Tell me!

293
00:25:50,604 --> 00:25:52,231
What would you like?

294
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,999
Some rum, please.

295
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:56,473
Is your daddy home already?

296
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,137
He told me to get it
this morning, but I forgot.

297
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,645
You forgot!

298
00:26:01,782 --> 00:26:03,750
A big girl like you, forget!
Shame!

299
00:26:03,884 --> 00:26:07,115
You remember to play,
but you forget errands!

300
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:09,449
The matches!

301
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,525
Is that all?

302
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:18,597
Yes, Madame Lina...

303
00:26:18,732 --> 00:26:20,825
Oh, I forgot...

304
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:25,233
I also wanted the matches.

305
00:26:37,984 --> 00:26:40,475
It burns.

306
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,781
You're too greedy!
Give it to me!

307
00:26:42,923 --> 00:26:45,721
Give me some!

308
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:48,623
Leave some for us!

309
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:03,600
When Twelve-Toes is drink,
he walks on all fours,

310
00:27:03,744 --> 00:27:06,178
and grunts...

311
00:27:06,313 --> 00:27:09,544
like a pig.

312
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:13,414
When my daddy is drunk,
he says, "I'm the boss,"

313
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:17,353
"and don't go thinking
I'm drunk!"

314
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:43,876
Fire...

315
00:27:58,064 --> 00:28:01,659
Fire, fire, fire...

316
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:48,239
What'll we do
with these kids?

317
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:51,009
They put rum on my bill
at the store.

318
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:51,947
Punish her!

319
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:54,053
You burned everything
I owned!

320
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:55,916
I'm a tough girl!

321
00:28:56,056 --> 00:28:58,251
We'll see if you're tough!

322
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:10,231
My head is spinning!

323
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,534
Now Julien's stick will spin...
on your behind!

324
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:17,199
Shame on you!
Burning my garden, my chickens.

325
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:20,438
Little bastards!

326
00:29:21,448 --> 00:29:23,313
Scoundrel!

327
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,908
Aren't you ashamed,
beating a child like that?

328
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:28,543
Listen to that!

329
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:31,657
They burned my garden,
my chickens.

330
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:34,316
Now, I'm in the wrong!

331
00:29:34,461 --> 00:29:37,328
Careful!
Don't mess with me!

332
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:48,773
Sir, the manager is here.

333
00:29:52,612 --> 00:29:55,479
I told you to do your job
carefully!

334
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:57,776
We sent for you
because of the fire.

335
00:29:57,918 --> 00:29:59,681
Look at that!

336
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:02,811
Your cane gets dirtier
all the time.

337
00:30:02,956 --> 00:30:05,925
It's more than 20% rubbish!

338
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,790
Look at it!
What's that?

339
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,093
I can't make sugar
with cane like that!

340
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:15,627
You ape!

341
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:17,396
You wrapped each cane...

342
00:30:17,537 --> 00:30:19,767
...in dead leaves!
- I'll break your ass!

343
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:24,568
And what about this fire?

344
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:27,544
And I build houses
for them!

345
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:31,481
Next, they'll set fire
to my cane!

346
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:33,210
The kids shouldn't
hang around there!

347
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:34,752
What'll do with them?

348
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:37,721
We could use
some extra help.

349
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:52,398
What's that?
That's a bundle of cane?

350
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:54,439
Each cane must be
3 feet long.

351
00:31:02,182 --> 00:31:05,549
You're always thirsty, scram!

352
00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:11,089
Lazybones!

353
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:14,819
Your grandmother thinks
you'll get a government job.

354
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:28,235
You're not working.

355
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:31,970
Saturday we'll get paid.
You'll get nothing!

356
00:31:32,112 --> 00:31:33,909
Go away, little boy!

357
00:31:41,221 --> 00:31:44,349
I want to work too.

358
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:46,686
I'm the only kid
not working.

359
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:51,024
I won't let you end up
in the cane fields.

360
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:53,724
Like all blacks
without pride...

361
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:57,928
...who throw their kids
into the same misery!

362
00:31:58,071 --> 00:32:01,234
Tortilla came to get Ma Tine
to deliver her ma's baby.

363
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:04,537
But it was stillborn
like her last.

364
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:06,577
Ma Tine said...

365
00:32:06,713 --> 00:32:11,582
"Another kid saved from
the white man's cane fields."

366
00:32:11,718 --> 00:32:15,279
I thought only of one thing.

367
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:19,222
My first meeting
with my new schoolteacher...

368
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,350
Mr. Stephen Roc.

369
00:32:21,494 --> 00:32:24,395
Behave at Madame Leonce's.

370
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:30,325
Show that you're well
brought up.

371
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,665
Don't worry.

372
00:32:32,806 --> 00:32:36,435
Paul, we'll be late
for school.

373
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:42,944
You're lucky she agreed...

374
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:46,849
to do us this favor.

375
00:32:58,264 --> 00:32:59,754
I heard them!

376
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:02,197
Flying over the roof.
They were so noisy!

377
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:05,236
You think they're birds,
but they're witches.

378
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:06,338
Zombies, real devils!

379
00:33:06,473 --> 00:33:07,440
You saw them?

380
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:10,372
You crazy?
They might break my leg...

381
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,740
twist my mouth,
push in my eyes.

382
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:14,312
Then what?

383
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:17,848
Grandma says to put
a wooden cross on the roof.

384
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:19,349
It breaks their wings...

385
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:21,317
and the fall down.

386
00:33:21,454 --> 00:33:22,921
Some don't fly.

387
00:33:23,056 --> 00:33:25,684
They become dogs,
cats and snakes.

388
00:33:25,825 --> 00:33:27,986
And if you go out...

389
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:30,824
at midnight...
you've had it!

390
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:34,229
There's a 3-legged horse
that gallops every night.

391
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:36,096
It goes cloppity,
cloppity, cloppity.

392
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:38,397
I'll tell you something...

393
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:41,006
But don't tell anyone.

394
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:42,802
Mr. Godisar, the druggist...

395
00:33:42,942 --> 00:33:46,275
and Miss Antoine,
from the Town Hall...

396
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:48,676
They're both witches.

397
00:33:48,815 --> 00:33:51,784
As for the whites...
they're devils.

398
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:55,479
Don't ever look at them
at night!

399
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:59,490
Just clench some earth
in your hand and say:

400
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:01,821
Back, Satan!

401
00:34:01,961 --> 00:34:04,987
Liar! That's just stories.

402
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:07,122
Zombies don't exist!

403
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:08,894
What did you say?
Repeat it!

404
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:12,436
I said you're a liar!

405
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:16,372
You don't know about whites.
They've got everything.

406
00:34:16,509 --> 00:34:19,910
They don't need
to become cats or dogs.

407
00:34:20,046 --> 00:34:23,675
Ask your dad if a cat or dog
sent him to work in a factory!

408
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:48,040
The School Certificate...

409
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:52,076
is most indispensable
to the humblest of people.

410
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:56,173
Those who work hard enough
to earn it...

411
00:34:56,316 --> 00:34:59,410
will be certain to lead
a decent life.

412
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:02,487
For the others,
as you know,

413
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:06,285
it'll be the cane fields.

414
00:35:06,426 --> 00:35:11,295
With the School Certificate
some may go right to work...

415
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:13,490
or go on...

416
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:17,865
to study for the Elementary
Teacher's Certificate.

417
00:35:18,004 --> 00:35:21,906
The others...
the best ones...

418
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:26,478
may try for some scholarships
in Fort-de-France.

419
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:32,377
Now take your books,

420
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:38,456
and write on the middle
of the first page...

421
00:35:38,591 --> 00:35:42,527
a sentence you should read
every morning.

422
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:49,026
"Learning..."

423
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:54,299
"is the key that opens
the second door to our freedom."

424
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,307
Write it down.

425
00:36:08,955 --> 00:36:12,083
Jose, won't you eat with us?

426
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:13,487
Ma Tine won't let me.

427
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:14,752
Too bad!

428
00:36:14,894 --> 00:36:17,192
Anyway, I'm mad at you.

429
00:36:22,368 --> 00:36:25,428
Hello, Madame Fusil...
how are you?

430
00:36:25,571 --> 00:36:27,937
Hello, son.
How's your grandma?

431
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:31,601
Not well today.
When it rains, her knee hurts.

432
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:07,905
Here, young fellow.

433
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:09,912
Eat this.

434
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:13,576
Tell your grandma
that she needn't bother.

435
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,688
I'll make your lunch.

436
00:37:15,822 --> 00:37:17,119
Thank you, Madame Leonce.

437
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:21,625
Will you do me a favor?

438
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:22,785
Yes, Ma'am.

439
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:25,397
Shine some shoes for me.

440
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:44,411
What did the teacher
teach you today?

441
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,518
Lots of things.

442
00:37:46,652 --> 00:37:50,679
I learned:
"class dismissed!"

443
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:53,189
"Gesner, Albicy,
don't cheat!"

444
00:37:53,326 --> 00:37:56,318
"Vireil, extend your arms!"

445
00:37:57,597 --> 00:37:59,929
Ma says, "Thank you."

446
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:02,296
Thanks, dear.

447
00:38:07,473 --> 00:38:10,738
That's all he taught you,
all day?

448
00:38:10,877 --> 00:38:12,538
I'm just teasing you.

449
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:14,737
We learned the difference...

450
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:17,076
between counties
and districts.

451
00:38:17,216 --> 00:38:20,549
Like Creuse and Aubusson.

452
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:21,880
Aubusson!

453
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:24,683
What names they have!

454
00:38:28,494 --> 00:38:32,225
Madame Leonce says,
don't bother making my lunch.

455
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:33,627
She has enough food.

456
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:36,030
Did you understand right?

457
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:39,138
That's what she said,
Grandma.

458
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:44,101
Impossible! She's already
letting you eat there.

459
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:47,701
I hope it wasn't
your idea!

460
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:50,839
No, Grandma.

461
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,184
What is this?

462
00:39:29,222 --> 00:39:31,816
It's patagon...

463
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:35,359
Patagon tea cures
a sore throat.

464
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:38,658
You didn't forget.

465
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:44,930
All things in creation
have their secrets.

466
00:39:46,172 --> 00:39:48,072
The soil has a secret.

467
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:52,371
Water has a secret.
Fire has a secret!

468
00:39:52,512 --> 00:39:54,946
Life!

469
00:39:55,081 --> 00:39:59,984
Don't think that water and fire
are enemies. No!

470
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,782
They're the forces of creation.

471
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:07,120
Each needs the other
to create life!

472
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,661
Yes... they create life!

473
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:18,465
See that?

474
00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:20,595
What? The ant?

475
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:27,138
If I step on it,
it's all over.

476
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,772
But try making it
go again!

477
00:40:32,485 --> 00:40:37,445
No one must meddle
with life.

478
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,425
Man can only destroy life,
he can't recreate it!

479
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,620
My son...

480
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:48,734
Let creation settle
its own affairs.

481
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:53,498
We must learn to accept
the workings of creation...

482
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:56,107
without weeping or sorrow.

483
00:40:56,242 --> 00:40:59,575
Since, one way or another,
it always works out best.

484
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:10,283
Young lad, forget
your own name...

485
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:13,483
but don't ever forget that.

486
00:41:19,732 --> 00:41:21,859
Lisette!
Get out of there!

487
00:41:25,204 --> 00:41:26,762
Finished?

488
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:28,498
Yes, Madame Leonce.

489
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:33,010
You'll do one more little job
for me, my little black boy?

490
00:41:33,145 --> 00:41:35,875
But Ma'am...
I have to go to school!

491
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:37,778
I'm always late!

492
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:41,512
It'll just take 2 minutes.

493
00:41:49,895 --> 00:41:52,659
You forgot your dish.

494
00:41:52,798 --> 00:41:55,494
That's very good!

495
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:59,765
You're a very interesting
little boy.

496
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,952
Spread the dishes
in the sun.

497
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:24,392
I'll be late!

498
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,090
If you didn't talk so much,
you'd already be done.

499
00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:48,614
Stay there, Mr. Hassam!

500
00:42:48,754 --> 00:42:49,982
Albicy!

501
00:42:50,122 --> 00:42:52,556
Find a word that comes
from "terra."

502
00:42:57,496 --> 00:42:58,963
...Terminal...

503
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:02,067
Terminal?
That's awful!

504
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:04,761
Vireil! You try.

505
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,736
Why are you late,
Mr. Hassam?

506
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:14,971
Territory.

507
00:43:15,114 --> 00:43:16,706
Go and extend
your arms!

508
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:18,749
Territory.
Territory, sir!

509
00:43:18,884 --> 00:43:20,579
Good.

510
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,747
Now give me the opposite
of these words.

511
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:29,327
Tortilla Saint-Louis...
go to the blackboard.

512
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:33,825
Sale?

513
00:43:33,966 --> 00:43:36,799
Purchase.

514
00:43:54,153 --> 00:43:55,142
Jesus!

515
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:56,948
Little brat!

516
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,491
The end!

517
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,190
Thank you,
Miss Saint-Louis. Good!

518
00:44:10,302 --> 00:44:12,634
Come in, Mr. Hassam.

519
00:44:12,772 --> 00:44:16,469
Don't think you can escape
the vocabulary lesson!

520
00:44:23,149 --> 00:44:25,140
Mr. Hassam...

521
00:44:25,284 --> 00:44:29,118
tell us the difference
between...

522
00:44:29,255 --> 00:44:33,282
"cackling" and "singing."

523
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:35,723
Usually...

524
00:44:35,861 --> 00:44:40,264
we use the word "sing"
for people...

525
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:45,029
when their voices
express music.

526
00:44:45,171 --> 00:44:47,435
For instance...

527
00:44:47,573 --> 00:44:50,474
My grandma likes a good smoke,
she loves to sing.

528
00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:53,077
Quiet!

529
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:55,146
We also say
that animals sing:

530
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:57,715
turtledoves, pipits...
And mountain larks...

531
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,444
Things can sing too:

532
00:45:00,586 --> 00:45:03,487
the wind in the cane,
the falling rain...

533
00:45:03,622 --> 00:45:06,489
the rivers, even the wheels
of carts.

534
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,254
Some other words describe
the type of singing:

535
00:45:13,165 --> 00:45:15,895
a toad is said to croak...

536
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:19,168
Cart wheels...

537
00:45:19,305 --> 00:45:21,364
Squeak...
- They squeak.

538
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:25,267
When a hen lays an egg...

539
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:29,711
it sings to announce it.
That's called cackling.

540
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:31,840
Very good, Hassam.

541
00:45:33,285 --> 00:45:35,810
You defined the terms well...
but...

542
00:45:35,955 --> 00:45:40,551
such a brilliant student
shouldn't be late to school.

543
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:51,830
Leopold, your father said
not to talk to those children.

544
00:45:51,971 --> 00:45:53,939
Brat! I'll tell your ma!

545
00:46:05,718 --> 00:46:09,449
Good evening,
Madame Leonce!

546
00:46:19,398 --> 00:46:21,059
Little scoundrel!

547
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,258
I'll spank you!

548
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:24,801
Mongoose-head!

549
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:39,576
You've been with those
black kids again.

550
00:46:39,718 --> 00:46:43,245
Your father doesn't want you
to play with them.

551
00:47:06,812 --> 00:47:08,939
What's that, mother?

552
00:47:09,081 --> 00:47:13,347
The latest tune. Your father
had it sent from France.

553
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:16,215
Tamarind or plum juice?

554
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:17,686
I'll have plum.

555
00:48:11,076 --> 00:48:13,806
That boy exasperates me!

556
00:48:32,398 --> 00:48:34,992
Didn't I tell you
not to go out?

557
00:48:35,134 --> 00:48:38,126
You've been
to Mr. Medouze's 3 times.

558
00:48:39,805 --> 00:48:41,568
He's not there.

559
00:48:41,707 --> 00:48:43,675
Then, what were you doing
there?

560
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:49,714
You forget there's a time
to put food in your belly.

561
00:48:49,848 --> 00:48:51,338
Mr. Medouze isn't there.

562
00:48:51,483 --> 00:48:54,748
He can go where he wants.

563
00:49:01,393 --> 00:49:03,486
Grandma, Mr. Medouze...

564
00:49:03,629 --> 00:49:08,259
God's sake!
Don't pester me about him!

565
00:49:09,368 --> 00:49:12,235
It's not like
Mr. Medouze...

566
00:49:12,371 --> 00:49:15,169
He's wired
his door shut!

567
00:49:24,516 --> 00:49:27,007
Medouze isn't there!

568
00:49:27,152 --> 00:49:28,642
He's not in bed?

569
00:49:28,787 --> 00:49:31,347
No, Jose would've seen him.
He's gone!

570
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:32,855
Where could he be?

571
00:49:32,991 --> 00:49:36,290
Paul, bring the torch!

572
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:43,729
Ti Coco, get up!
Medouze has disappeared!

573
00:49:45,871 --> 00:49:48,203
Twelve-Toes, grab
your torch and machete!

574
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,137
Medouze isn't there?

575
00:49:50,275 --> 00:49:53,073
Hurry! We have
to look for him.

576
00:51:07,152 --> 00:51:09,120
He's here!

577
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,552
Mr. Saint-Louis,
where are you?

578
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:56,931
Ladies and gentlemen...

579
00:51:57,069 --> 00:51:58,331
the cane fields,

580
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,438
ate Mister Medouze's life.

581
00:52:00,572 --> 00:52:03,302
So he went to die
in the cane fields.

582
00:52:03,442 --> 00:52:06,036
He layed down his hide
and his old opossum's bones.

583
00:52:07,613 --> 00:52:10,707
May his soul rest in peace
in all the days to come.

584
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:13,579
Always, for time
in memoriam. Amen!

585
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:19,386
Ladies and gentlemen...

586
00:52:19,524 --> 00:52:21,458
Mister Medouze is dead,

587
00:52:21,593 --> 00:52:24,323
but don't let it pain
your hearts.

588
00:52:24,463 --> 00:52:26,897
For guess why,
ladies and gentlemen...

589
00:52:27,032 --> 00:52:30,126
why Medouze laid his old body
in the cane to die?

590
00:52:32,337 --> 00:52:37,570
If he hid his body to die
in the cane fields, he did it...

591
00:52:37,709 --> 00:52:39,267
so that we, his brothers...

592
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:42,403
would not inherit
his old sleeping board...

593
00:52:42,547 --> 00:52:45,414
smoothed by his old bones
and the pipe,

594
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:48,178
that never left him...
night or day.

595
00:52:53,492 --> 00:52:56,359
Mister Medouze didn't want
his old brothers,

596
00:52:56,495 --> 00:53:00,659
to inherit his bantam,
defeated in all its fights,

597
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,359
or his barrels of gold
and silver,

598
00:53:03,502 --> 00:53:06,471
that Whitey gave him
with a kick in the ass,

599
00:53:06,605 --> 00:53:08,072
saying, go on,
old nigger,

600
00:53:08,206 --> 00:53:09,764
smelling of piss,

601
00:53:09,908 --> 00:53:13,969
saying, go on, old nigger,
last generation after the toads!

602
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:27,420
Now Mr. Medouze
is on his way to Africa.

603
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:32,087
...And the dead who are dead
shall return to earth.

604
00:53:44,176 --> 00:53:45,973
I have an errand to do,

605
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,976
at the dressmaker,

606
00:53:48,113 --> 00:53:51,605
I'll stop to thank
Madame Leonce.

607
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,617
See the fine hen...
I'm bringing here.

608
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:58,382
Go, do your homework.
- Yes, Ma.

609
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,862
I'll be right back.

610
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:53,840
What'd you eat at noon?

611
00:54:56,848 --> 00:54:59,339
Nothing.
- Nothing?

612
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:00,974
Nothing at all?

613
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,814
Plum juice...

614
00:55:02,954 --> 00:55:05,422
Gustard apple.

615
00:55:05,557 --> 00:55:07,286
That's no nourishment!

616
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:13,362
Why didn't you tell me
what happened with Leonce?

617
00:55:17,202 --> 00:55:19,762
Go get your books
and your bedding.

618
00:55:32,684 --> 00:55:34,015
Where are you going?

619
00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:38,552
Ask her!

620
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:40,988
Me? You're crazy!

621
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:51,197
Hurry up!

622
00:56:00,545 --> 00:56:04,709
Now we'll go to town
to live with Madame Fusil.

623
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,841
I'll cook for you myself.

624
00:56:06,985 --> 00:56:10,318
God will give me
the strength and courage...

625
00:56:10,455 --> 00:56:15,051
to return
to Whitey's cane fields.

626
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,528
Remember, tomorrow I'll ask
again about Alpine glaciers.

627
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:21,927
Class dismissed!

628
00:56:25,837 --> 00:56:28,567
Evening, Godmother Fanny.

629
00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:33,169
Evening, teacher.

630
00:56:41,152 --> 00:56:42,119
Where is God?

631
00:56:42,254 --> 00:56:44,814
God is everywhere,

632
00:56:44,956 --> 00:56:47,652
in Heaven, on earth,

633
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:49,817
and in all places.

634
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:52,395
What is man's fate?

635
00:56:52,531 --> 00:56:55,591
Man's fate is...

636
00:56:55,734 --> 00:56:58,464
...death, judgment,

637
00:56:58,603 --> 00:57:01,970
Heaven and hell.

638
00:57:02,107 --> 00:57:03,699
What is Heaven?

639
00:57:03,842 --> 00:57:05,776
Heaven is...

640
00:57:05,911 --> 00:57:07,879
Gesner!

641
00:57:08,013 --> 00:57:10,709
...fear and respect
in God's house.

642
00:57:10,849 --> 00:57:14,250
Heaven is a place
of delight,

643
00:57:14,386 --> 00:57:16,820
where the Saints and God,

644
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:18,889
enjoy eternal happiness.

645
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:20,457
All together.

646
00:57:30,635 --> 00:57:32,466
Once more!

647
00:57:41,546 --> 00:57:43,241
What is hell?

648
00:57:43,381 --> 00:57:47,317
Hell is a place
of torments...

649
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:02,994
Mr. de Thorail!

650
00:58:03,134 --> 00:58:05,068
You know that white man?

651
00:58:05,203 --> 00:58:08,001
He's my father!
- Your papa!

652
00:58:10,408 --> 00:58:12,569
Blessed by the Pope!

653
00:58:12,711 --> 00:58:15,339
Specially shipped
from Lourdes to Rome.

654
00:58:16,514 --> 00:58:19,108
Kneel, children...

655
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:21,844
Let us pray to thank
Mr. Auberville.

656
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:36,362
Your grandmother's sick.

657
00:58:37,569 --> 00:58:40,333
Mister Saint-Louis
brought her back.

658
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:46,175
I've done everything
I could.

659
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:48,836
But if she's not better
tomorrow...

660
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,574
she'll have to go
to the doctor.

661
00:58:51,716 --> 00:58:53,616
I made your supper.

662
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,251
Eat it all, now.

663
00:59:04,396 --> 00:59:06,762
I'll come by for news
tomorrow.

664
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:15,967
Don't worry... Eat.

665
00:59:16,107 --> 00:59:18,200
Thank you, Madame Fusil.

666
00:59:18,343 --> 00:59:20,777
Good night, my boy.

667
00:59:34,826 --> 00:59:37,420
Have you eaten?

668
00:59:37,562 --> 00:59:39,757
Yes, Grandma.

669
00:59:40,832 --> 00:59:43,062
Wash your feet.

670
00:59:43,201 --> 00:59:45,726
Make your bed!

671
00:59:48,173 --> 00:59:50,004
You're still here?

672
00:59:55,914 --> 00:59:58,007
What do you want?

673
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:08,318
You'll see, Grandma...

674
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:12,021
Some day
I'll take care of you.

675
01:00:12,163 --> 01:00:16,998
We'll have a big house...
with flowers...

676
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:20,627
hen, rabbits, pigs...

677
01:00:20,772 --> 01:00:23,297
You won't have to go
to the cane fields.

678
01:00:23,441 --> 01:00:27,468
Don't forget your prayers.

679
01:00:27,612 --> 01:00:30,274
Good night, Grandma.

680
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,880
I wouldn't mind
a little smoke.

681
01:02:30,935 --> 01:02:34,393
You shouldn't be here,
and you know it.

682
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:37,872
With that barefoot boy,

683
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:39,840
who can't speak French.

684
01:02:39,978 --> 01:02:41,969
I told you not to see him.

685
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:47,784
Bring me the horse!

686
01:02:52,156 --> 01:02:54,488
Bring that horse, dammit!

687
01:03:48,546 --> 01:03:51,640
He says he's going to die.

688
01:03:54,185 --> 01:03:56,346
Don't cry.

689
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:01,823
What'll become of us?

690
01:04:05,196 --> 01:04:06,993
I'm here, Mother.

691
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:13,598
Don't stay here.
Go, do your homework.

692
01:04:19,811 --> 01:04:21,802
What did he say?

693
01:04:45,036 --> 01:04:48,597
Your spleen is ruptured,

694
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:51,641
and it's bleeding internally.

695
01:04:51,776 --> 01:04:54,711
So, it's all over.
- Don't say that.

696
01:04:54,846 --> 01:04:56,814
The doctor may be
mistaken.

697
01:04:58,616 --> 01:05:01,346
My plots of land
in Baufond...

698
01:05:01,486 --> 01:05:04,478
they're for Leopold.

699
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:17,199
I'm the last de Thorail
who wore it.

700
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:19,667
Now it's his.

701
01:05:19,804 --> 01:05:24,070
If Leopold lost
all those properties...

702
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:26,733
what would he have
of yours?

703
01:05:26,878 --> 01:05:30,712
Please, recognize him.

704
01:05:30,848 --> 01:05:32,509
Having your name
would be...

705
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:35,050
the most lasting
inheritance.

706
01:05:35,186 --> 01:05:37,051
De Thorail...

707
01:05:38,456 --> 01:05:41,653
That name was borne
by generations of whites.

708
01:05:41,793 --> 01:05:44,626
It's not for Leopold.

709
01:05:45,496 --> 01:05:46,963
But he's your son!

710
01:05:47,098 --> 01:05:48,793
It's not a mulatto's name.

711
01:05:48,933 --> 01:05:50,696
It's a white man's.

712
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:53,633
Father!
- Leopold!

713
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,006
He doesn't want me!

714
01:06:03,714 --> 01:06:06,274
Two days later,
Mr. de Thorail died.

715
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:09,318
All the rich whites came.

716
01:06:09,454 --> 01:06:11,388
But Leopold...

717
01:06:11,522 --> 01:06:16,323
hadn't returned,
and was missing from school.

718
01:06:16,461 --> 01:06:21,330
The School Certificate exam
was soon upon us.

719
01:06:21,466 --> 01:06:25,562
All ten pupils chosen
by Mr. Roc passed it.

720
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:43,582
May I have a word with you
both in private?

721
01:06:43,721 --> 01:06:45,916
This way, please.

722
01:06:51,295 --> 01:06:54,321
I chose your 2 children...

723
01:06:54,465 --> 01:06:58,196
to represent our school
in the scholarship exam

724
01:06:58,336 --> 01:07:00,463
next week
in Fort-de-France.

725
01:07:00,605 --> 01:07:01,799
Well?

726
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:03,634
Mr. Roc...

727
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:09,144
I'm deeply moved
by what you've told me.

728
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:14,377
I can't let her continue.

729
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:16,111
I can't...

730
01:07:16,254 --> 01:07:19,781
There are my other kids.

731
01:07:19,924 --> 01:07:22,722
And the post-mistress...

732
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:26,227
is trying to find her
a little job.

733
01:07:26,364 --> 01:07:28,423
Do you realize
how lucky she is?

734
01:07:28,566 --> 01:07:30,693
I know... But I can't,

735
01:07:30,835 --> 01:07:32,530
I really can't.

736
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:34,900
I understand.

737
01:07:45,216 --> 01:07:47,207
And you, Madame?

738
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,087
I'll do all I can.

739
01:07:54,225 --> 01:07:56,591
He'll have to succeed!

740
01:07:56,727 --> 01:07:58,922
It won't be easy,
I warn you.

741
01:07:59,063 --> 01:08:02,089
But I'm sure he'll pass.

742
01:08:02,233 --> 01:08:05,259
Because he's a brilliant
student.

743
01:08:17,215 --> 01:08:19,649
Clean now?
- Fine.

744
01:08:24,722 --> 01:08:27,156
Now I'll find out
what's in there.

745
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:50,279
Just put it on,
and leave me in peace!

746
01:08:52,116 --> 01:08:53,708
Even in Black Shack Alley...

747
01:08:53,851 --> 01:08:56,911
you were sure
I'd pass the exam?

748
01:09:02,193 --> 01:09:04,923
Hurry, Madame Amantine.
You're late.

749
01:09:11,769 --> 01:09:13,760
We're ready, Captain!

750
01:09:24,715 --> 01:09:26,842
Going to Fort-de-France?

751
01:09:35,793 --> 01:09:37,886
Read all about it!

752
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:40,429
"The People's Voice"!

753
01:09:40,564 --> 01:09:43,192
Paper, sir?
The latest news.

754
01:10:23,207 --> 01:10:26,404
"Farmers everywhere
dug up the soil,"

755
01:10:26,544 --> 01:10:29,945
"to kill the locust eggs."

756
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:33,209
"Each lump of earth
was turned over,"

757
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:35,842
"carefully broken up."

758
01:10:35,986 --> 01:10:38,614
"It was a pitiful sight."

759
01:10:38,756 --> 01:10:41,884
"Thousands of white roots
full of sap,"

760
01:10:42,026 --> 01:10:46,258
"could be seen
in the crumbling fertile soil."

761
01:10:47,732 --> 01:10:50,701
Alphonse Daudet.

762
01:10:50,835 --> 01:10:53,360
First question:

763
01:10:57,975 --> 01:11:00,739
explain the following words:

764
01:11:03,114 --> 01:11:05,344
"disaster"...

765
01:11:07,485 --> 01:11:09,612
"scourge"...

766
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,549
"sap".

767
01:11:16,761 --> 01:11:19,025
Good! Very good!

768
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,235
Damn! You made a mistake
in the last question.

769
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:35,811
We did the same problem
so often!

770
01:11:35,946 --> 01:11:39,905
I don't know how you did
in dictation, but...

771
01:11:40,718 --> 01:11:42,811
How Ma Tine has changed!

772
01:11:42,953 --> 01:11:46,150
I don't know
the right word.

773
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:50,158
At least she lets me lie
on her bed...

774
01:11:50,294 --> 01:11:53,127
Ah! Grown ups!

775
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:55,992
Ladies and gentlemen.

776
01:11:56,133 --> 01:11:58,465
Lucky guy!

777
01:12:00,538 --> 01:12:02,165
He passed!

778
01:12:02,306 --> 01:12:04,365
Thank you, Holy Mother!

779
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:10,273
Tomorrow, you register.
The courses start at once.

780
01:12:10,414 --> 01:12:15,249
You'll have to ask if
he's a boarder or a day pupil.

781
01:12:17,555 --> 01:12:20,683
Good luck, my boy.

782
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:24,150
The overseer's office, please?

783
01:12:24,295 --> 01:12:26,456
Over there.

784
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:54,887
Morning, Mr. Overseer.

785
01:12:55,025 --> 01:12:58,256
Here's Jose Hassam.

786
01:13:00,431 --> 01:13:02,194
You're his mother?

787
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:03,823
No, Sir.

788
01:13:03,968 --> 01:13:07,426
She's dead.
But I'm raising him.

789
01:13:12,843 --> 01:13:15,277
He's been granted
a 1/4 scholarship.

790
01:13:15,412 --> 01:13:19,109
But you'll have to pay
87.50 francs tuition.

791
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:22,447
87.50?

792
01:13:22,586 --> 01:13:24,554
Yes, Madame,
per trimester.

793
01:13:24,688 --> 01:13:26,155
Per trimester?

794
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:30,090
Yes. Every 3 months.

795
01:13:30,227 --> 01:13:32,024
What about
his scholarship?

796
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:34,027
After you've paid
the tuition,

797
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:36,860
which is due within
2 weeks.

798
01:13:37,001 --> 01:13:39,868
87.50!

799
01:13:40,004 --> 01:13:42,063
Does he get board?

800
01:13:42,206 --> 01:13:45,141
No, he's a day pupil.

801
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:46,573
But...

802
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:49,406
I don't make the rules!

803
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:56,281
87.50!

804
01:14:07,398 --> 01:14:09,958
They're wicked.

805
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:15,402
1/4 scholarship!
That's like giving nothing!

806
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:20,203
They don't know
I'm a fighting woman!

807
01:14:20,344 --> 01:14:23,973
I won't give up
that 1/4 scholarship!

808
01:14:24,114 --> 01:14:26,947
We'll move
to Fort-de-France.

809
01:14:27,084 --> 01:14:29,644
You'll attend their school!

810
01:14:29,787 --> 01:14:32,085
2 large rolls.

811
01:14:47,538 --> 01:14:50,769
They're stupid...
with those silly cars!

812
01:14:54,812 --> 01:14:58,373
What'll we do?
School starts tomorrow.

813
01:14:58,515 --> 01:15:02,713
I'll go home to get
your things ready.

814
01:15:02,853 --> 01:15:06,118
Until we find a place...

815
01:15:06,256 --> 01:15:08,952
you could stay
with Carmen.

816
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,886
He rents a room
from his bosses.

817
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:14,588
Well-roasted peanuts!

818
01:15:20,571 --> 01:15:22,436
He's there.

819
01:15:22,573 --> 01:15:25,474
We'll wait.
He's busy now.

820
01:15:27,878 --> 01:15:29,937
Look, Grandma.

821
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:42,251
Did it all go well?

822
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:46,452
Could I sleep in your room
a few nights?

823
01:15:46,597 --> 01:15:48,155
School starts tomorrow.

824
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:50,892
My bosses wouldn't allow it.

825
01:15:51,035 --> 01:15:53,526
Grandma's going home.

826
01:15:53,671 --> 01:15:56,231
But I have nowhere to stay,

827
01:15:56,373 --> 01:15:58,500
and school starts tomorrow.

828
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:00,269
I have an idea.

829
01:16:00,411 --> 01:16:03,107
Sleep on the boat after
the last trip.

830
01:16:03,247 --> 01:16:05,875
I'll wake you
at daybreak.

831
01:16:06,016 --> 01:16:10,976
Thank you, son.
God bless you.

832
01:16:11,121 --> 01:16:12,816
Don't mention it, Ma Tine.

833
01:16:14,892 --> 01:16:17,725
Forgive me for butting in...

834
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:20,853
There's a place on the other
side of the town.

835
01:16:20,998 --> 01:16:22,590
It's only an empty car crate...

836
01:16:22,733 --> 01:16:25,258
Some people move out
of it yesterday.

837
01:16:25,936 --> 01:16:28,962
Holy Virgin, give me
the strength...

838
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:31,734
to hold out here
in Fort-de-France...

839
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:41,249
in this wicked town...

840
01:16:41,385 --> 01:16:45,651
Too many people, too much noise,
too many cars.

841
01:16:45,789 --> 01:16:50,089
You can't cross the street
without being honked at.

842
01:16:50,227 --> 01:16:53,993
Listen to that!
That's no life!

843
01:16:58,035 --> 01:17:00,663
Careful with your suit.

844
01:17:00,804 --> 01:17:03,796
Don't get it dirty
for school.

845
01:17:03,941 --> 01:17:05,704
Don't worry, Grandma.

846
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:20,387
You'll see,
a month from now...

847
01:17:20,524 --> 01:17:22,651
when people ask you,
"Where are you from?"

848
01:17:22,793 --> 01:17:24,886
You'll say:

849
01:17:25,028 --> 01:17:26,427
"Fort-de-France,
of course!"

850
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:28,394
Me? Amantine?

851
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:05,825
In the 5th century, there were
4 great playwrights.

852
01:18:05,969 --> 01:18:10,963
Aeschylus, Sophocles,
Euripides and Aristophanes.

853
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,413
I didn't do it!

854
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:26,851
Break it!

855
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:27,718
Go on!

856
01:18:27,858 --> 01:18:28,984
I don't want to!

857
01:18:29,126 --> 01:18:31,094
You'll be sorry.

858
01:19:14,838 --> 01:19:17,398
It's you, Carmen.
Are you O. K?

859
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:19,771
Old Whitey tried to ruin
my day...

860
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:22,208
but I don't let it
upset me.

861
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:39,322
Very good!
No mistakes.

862
01:19:39,463 --> 01:19:40,589
Really?

863
01:19:40,731 --> 01:19:42,665
Not a single mistake!

864
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:47,564
That was my biggest
sorrow.

865
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:49,968
Now, I'm ready!

866
01:19:51,475 --> 01:19:54,842
That's why I'm a houseboy
for those fancy people...

867
01:19:54,978 --> 01:19:57,742
why I save on the boat,
and at the cinema...

868
01:19:57,881 --> 01:20:02,511
For years, I've wanted to be
an actor.

869
01:20:02,653 --> 01:20:05,679
Now I feel I'm ready.

870
01:20:05,822 --> 01:20:10,350
I'll go to Hollywood.
Some day I'll be famous.

871
01:20:10,494 --> 01:20:12,121
I have to get back.

872
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,525
Carmen is the right name
for you!

873
01:20:18,669 --> 01:20:19,863
How come?

874
01:20:20,003 --> 01:20:21,470
It means "charm"!

875
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:25,508
Good night!

876
01:20:25,642 --> 01:20:28,304
Your paper's good,
de Chazal.

877
01:20:28,445 --> 01:20:31,505
Arnaud!
Mr. Arnaud!

878
01:20:31,648 --> 01:20:34,378
It's hopeless.

879
01:20:34,518 --> 01:20:36,748
No imagination,

880
01:20:36,887 --> 01:20:38,787
no syntax.

881
01:20:38,922 --> 01:20:41,083
It's a disgrace.

882
01:20:43,994 --> 01:20:48,397
And now, Hassam's paper!

883
01:20:48,532 --> 01:20:51,262
Be quiet, Fontaine.

884
01:20:53,136 --> 01:20:57,163
Hassam describes
his great friendship...

885
01:20:57,307 --> 01:20:59,969
with a very old man
named Medouze...

886
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:03,079
who was, in a way,
his spiritual father...

887
01:21:03,213 --> 01:21:05,408
and who, the cane killed.

888
01:21:05,549 --> 01:21:07,915
He ends in these words...

889
01:21:08,051 --> 01:21:11,418
"Although I like to chew
the ends of sugar cane,"

890
01:21:11,555 --> 01:21:15,787
"a cane field will always be
an accursed place to me."

891
01:21:15,926 --> 01:21:20,090
"Where blacks are doomed
at age 8 to weed and hoe,"

892
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:24,223
"in withering storms,
and the devouring sun."

893
01:21:24,368 --> 01:21:27,064
"Blacks in rags,
stinking of sweat"

894
01:21:27,204 --> 01:21:28,535
"and dung,"

895
01:21:28,672 --> 01:21:32,699
"fed on a handful of flour
and 2 cents worth of rum,"

896
01:21:32,843 --> 01:21:36,643
"who collapse miserably
one night,"

897
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,874
"in a row of cane,"

898
01:21:40,017 --> 01:21:44,579
"and die on a grimy plank
on the ground,"

899
01:21:44,721 --> 01:21:47,212
"in an empty, filthy shack!"

900
01:21:47,357 --> 01:21:48,881
Mr. Hassam...

901
01:21:49,026 --> 01:21:50,653
you didn't write this.

902
01:21:50,794 --> 01:21:52,421
You cheated!

903
01:21:52,562 --> 01:21:54,257
No... No, sir!

904
01:21:54,398 --> 01:21:55,365
Be quiet!

905
01:21:55,499 --> 01:21:57,057
I don't know from where
you copied,

906
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,792
but I'm sure you did.

907
01:22:00,737 --> 01:22:05,504
Sir, with all due respect,
you're wrong!

908
01:22:05,642 --> 01:22:08,110
Don't persist.
You know you're lying.

909
01:22:08,245 --> 01:22:11,112
You're wrong, Sir!

910
01:22:11,248 --> 01:22:14,479
I didn't cheat!

911
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,428
Get back inside!

912
01:22:43,146 --> 01:22:46,638
Remember, we're dining
at the Governor's.

913
01:23:01,932 --> 01:23:04,560
Where have you been?

914
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:11,636
Pick me up at 2 p.m.
at Madame de la Tour's.

915
01:23:25,722 --> 01:23:27,690
What are you doing here?

916
01:23:30,494 --> 01:23:33,486
You've been crying?
What's wrong, Jo?

917
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:38,966
That homework
I did the other night...

918
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:42,304
The teacher said
I copied it from a book.

919
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:44,031
He said that?

920
01:23:46,076 --> 01:23:47,907
I'll see the principal.

921
01:23:48,044 --> 01:23:51,480
Are you crazy?
He'd never side with you.

922
01:23:51,615 --> 01:23:56,279
I'd see the teacher.
Talk to him man to man.

923
01:23:56,419 --> 01:23:58,387
He won't listen!

924
01:23:58,522 --> 01:23:59,989
Forget it!

925
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:01,750
He's a horse's ass!

926
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:13,833
Come on...

927
01:24:17,607 --> 01:24:19,700
Is this Fourachaux?

928
01:24:19,843 --> 01:24:21,504
Yes, sir.
- Where's Jose Hassam?

929
01:24:21,645 --> 01:24:23,613
Beyond the steps,
down below.

930
01:24:23,747 --> 01:24:25,237
Thanks a lot.

931
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:29,577
You're wrong.

932
01:24:29,719 --> 01:24:32,415
It's a gift from the boss
behind his back.

933
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:37,559
You've never seen anything
so fine, have you?

934
01:24:48,572 --> 01:24:51,507
Welcome to Madame's
bedroom!

935
01:24:53,677 --> 01:24:56,578
Look, she's getting
impatient!

936
01:25:07,557 --> 01:25:10,287
I'm her "cheri".

937
01:25:10,427 --> 01:25:12,861
I swear to you! Look!

938
01:25:12,996 --> 01:25:15,294
Think I could convince
the teacher?

939
01:25:15,432 --> 01:25:18,230
Look! She bites
when she kisses me.

940
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:20,359
She says it's to make me
think of her.

941
01:25:20,503 --> 01:25:23,301
The boss's wife?
- Herself!

942
01:25:24,207 --> 01:25:28,610
One day,
she called, "Carmen!"

943
01:25:28,745 --> 01:25:30,337
Wait! Listen!

944
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,811
I run...

945
01:25:31,948 --> 01:25:33,575
...upstairs,
wait at the door.

946
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:38,286
"Come in, Carmen!"

947
01:25:38,421 --> 01:25:41,117
"Do you think my room
is pretty?"

948
01:25:41,258 --> 01:25:42,190
Yes, Ma'am.

949
01:25:42,325 --> 01:25:45,419
"I seem to recall you like
the ladies."

950
01:25:45,562 --> 01:25:47,655
Just stories, Ma'am.

951
01:25:47,797 --> 01:25:50,630
"Then... it's not true?"

952
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:54,635
"You don't like women?"

953
01:25:54,771 --> 01:25:56,204
I didn't say that, Ma'am.

954
01:25:56,339 --> 01:25:59,035
"But you know
you're seductive,"

955
01:25:59,175 --> 01:26:01,109
and you appeal to them."

956
01:26:01,244 --> 01:26:02,472
I don't know, Ma'am.

957
01:26:02,612 --> 01:26:06,378
"Come closer... quickly!"

958
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:31,200
What is it, Hassam?

959
01:26:55,565 --> 01:26:57,533
Tell him I made a mistake.

960
01:26:59,502 --> 01:27:00,833
Come, Jose...

961
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:04,167
The teacher told me
your homework was fine.

962
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:09,110
See you tomorrow.

963
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:11,440
Real students are so rare.

964
01:27:18,321 --> 01:27:20,084
That child's crazy!

965
01:27:39,342 --> 01:27:41,003
I saw district super.

966
01:27:41,144 --> 01:27:43,009
He heads the scholarship
board.

967
01:27:43,146 --> 01:27:46,582
Your grandma won't have to worry
about your schooling.

968
01:27:46,716 --> 01:27:48,707
You'll get living
expenses, too.

969
01:27:50,854 --> 01:27:52,879
Your grandma can see
the bursar.

970
01:27:53,022 --> 01:27:54,717
Let's go in.

971
01:27:57,293 --> 01:28:01,389
300 francs, Grandma!
I never saw so much money!

972
01:28:04,901 --> 01:28:08,359
No more laundry!
No more ironing!

973
01:28:13,042 --> 01:28:16,443
It's lucky they raised
your allowance.

974
01:28:16,579 --> 01:28:20,572
To tell the truth,
I couldn't have gone on.

975
01:28:23,353 --> 01:28:25,344
Tomorrow, God willing...

976
01:28:25,488 --> 01:28:29,481
I'll see Mr. Singer,
the dressmaker.

977
01:28:29,626 --> 01:28:32,652
He'll make you another suit.

978
01:28:32,796 --> 01:28:35,890
Why go all that way
to the village?

979
01:28:36,032 --> 01:28:37,465
Order it here.

980
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,398
No! We can't do that to poor
Mr. Singer.

981
01:28:40,537 --> 01:28:44,598
And why enrich city folk
who can't even sew?

982
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:47,335
Mr. Singer needs
the money.

983
01:28:47,477 --> 01:28:49,843
Could you be waiting
to see your shack?

984
01:28:49,979 --> 01:28:53,437
What shack?
That toad-hole?

985
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:55,483
O.K. I'll deliver the laundry.

986
01:28:58,354 --> 01:29:00,413
And I'll tell them you quit.

987
01:29:00,557 --> 01:29:04,357
Ma Tine doesn't wash or iron
any more.

988
01:29:04,494 --> 01:29:08,123
Ma Tine does no more
ironing!

989
01:29:08,264 --> 01:29:11,597
Ma Tine does no more
washing!

990
01:29:21,211 --> 01:29:23,577
Remember to come for me
tomorrow night...

991
01:29:23,713 --> 01:29:25,112
on the last trip.

992
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,772
Don't worry, I'll be here.

993
01:29:26,916 --> 01:29:28,577
Kiss Tortilla and the rest!

994
01:30:02,352 --> 01:30:05,150
Stop, thief!

995
01:30:06,389 --> 01:30:08,880
See that? The thief...
That dog!

996
01:30:09,025 --> 01:30:11,016
Those people are hopeless:

997
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,822
I really detest that race!

998
01:30:13,963 --> 01:30:15,828
You shouldn't say that.

999
01:30:15,965 --> 01:30:19,059
What? I tell you,
I hate them!

1000
01:30:19,202 --> 01:30:21,397
How can I be proud
of my color,

1001
01:30:21,538 --> 01:30:24,632
when I see those people
fouling up every day?

1002
01:30:24,774 --> 01:30:27,174
It disgusts me!

1003
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:30,768
Anyway, except for my color,
I'm not black.

1004
01:30:30,914 --> 01:30:32,848
My character is white.

1005
01:30:32,982 --> 01:30:35,883
I'm sure no white ever yelled
"I hate my race",

1006
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:38,852
when another white stole,
or even murdered...

1007
01:30:38,988 --> 01:30:41,479
Then why, for a trifle,

1008
01:30:41,624 --> 01:30:43,888
are you willing to condemn
all blacks?

1009
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:45,551
You don't understand...

1010
01:30:45,695 --> 01:30:48,687
It hurts me so to see...

1011
01:30:48,831 --> 01:30:52,892
someone who's already black
do something bad.

1012
01:30:53,036 --> 01:30:55,937
Even for a trifle...

1013
01:30:56,072 --> 01:30:57,835
my impulse is to hurl my race
into the fire!

1014
01:30:57,974 --> 01:31:01,000
Then you'd never marry anyone
but a white?

1015
01:31:01,144 --> 01:31:03,510
At least my kids
would be light-skinned!

1016
01:31:08,818 --> 01:31:14,051
I have to meet my grandma.
Good bye, Miss Flora.

1017
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:18,092
Get your paper! President
Paul Doumer assassinated!

1018
01:31:18,227 --> 01:31:21,094
Read all about it!

1019
01:31:32,709 --> 01:31:35,109
Don't worry, she must have
missed the boat.

1020
01:31:35,244 --> 01:31:36,176
She'll come tomorrow!

1021
01:31:36,312 --> 01:31:38,906
She's never done that!

1022
01:31:43,886 --> 01:31:47,652
I must get there!
- How? By swimming?

1023
01:32:02,805 --> 01:32:05,433
Don't worry...
Kiss her for me.

1024
01:32:18,187 --> 01:32:19,620
Did they give you
the message?

1025
01:32:19,756 --> 01:32:21,189
What message?

1026
01:32:21,324 --> 01:32:23,383
I called Carmen' bosses.

1027
01:32:23,526 --> 01:32:25,016
Didn't the maid tell him?

1028
01:32:25,161 --> 01:32:27,891
I got worried.
So Carmen brought me.

1029
01:32:28,031 --> 01:32:30,090
My little Jose.

1030
01:32:30,233 --> 01:32:32,098
What's wrong with you,
Grandma?

1031
01:32:32,235 --> 01:32:34,931
Yesterday, the body
was not good at all.

1032
01:32:35,071 --> 01:32:39,007
I weeded around the shack.

1033
01:32:39,142 --> 01:32:43,374
I suddenly felt as if a big
stone had hit me, here.

1034
01:32:43,513 --> 01:32:46,949
But it's better now.

1035
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:49,574
Really?
You don't feel anything?

1036
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:53,382
Old people are like
old machines.

1037
01:32:53,523 --> 01:32:55,957
They keep going,
purely by routine!

1038
01:32:56,092 --> 01:32:59,118
And they can be stronger
than new ones, right?

1039
01:32:59,262 --> 01:33:02,254
Let's take a little stroll.

1040
01:33:02,398 --> 01:33:04,161
Help me, Tortilla.

1041
01:33:08,337 --> 01:33:11,397
My legs are still weak.

1042
01:33:35,598 --> 01:33:39,864
The postmistress
will scold you for being late.

1043
01:33:40,002 --> 01:33:42,197
So what?

1044
01:33:42,338 --> 01:33:45,034
Tobacco opens the mind,
doesn't it?

1045
01:33:48,077 --> 01:33:49,271
Good, isn't it?

1046
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:56,275
Jose. Tortilla's fiance!

1047
01:33:56,419 --> 01:33:58,114
They arrested Leopold!

1048
01:33:58,254 --> 01:34:00,449
Which Leopold?
My friend, Leopold?

1049
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:04,720
He came back and stole
Whitey's ledger!

1050
01:34:04,861 --> 01:34:07,056
No, that's not it!
He took the ledger...

1051
01:34:07,196 --> 01:34:10,165
so the police came for him.

1052
01:34:10,299 --> 01:34:12,631
I didn't want to tell you
right away.

1053
01:34:12,769 --> 01:34:14,999
Where is he?
- At the factory.

1054
01:34:15,138 --> 01:34:18,266
The watchman caught him
at 4 a.m.

1055
01:34:18,407 --> 01:34:21,171
My dad said he took
the ledger to prove...

1056
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:22,834
...Whitey's cheating us all.

1057
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:26,210
They set the cops on him.
- Poor child!

1058
01:34:27,717 --> 01:34:29,742
Will you stay with
Ma Tine?

1059
01:34:29,886 --> 01:34:32,650
I'll be right back...
I must see him.

1060
01:34:38,661 --> 01:34:40,458
Murderer! What are you doing
to that child?

1061
01:34:40,596 --> 01:34:43,190
Let him go...
Whitey's niggers!

1062
01:35:02,518 --> 01:35:05,385
Martinique you suffer...

1063
01:35:05,521 --> 01:35:08,012
Life is fading away...

1064
01:35:08,157 --> 01:35:11,024
Young folk are regressing...

1065
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:14,391
The men and the women...
are desperate...

1066
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:16,998
Yet we all live simply...

1067
01:35:17,133 --> 01:35:19,624
What we lack is money...

1068
01:35:19,769 --> 01:35:22,636
And, as for justice...

1069
01:35:22,772 --> 01:35:25,172
Don't even mention it!

1070
01:35:25,308 --> 01:35:28,209
I crossed over the sea...
to go and see...

1071
01:35:28,344 --> 01:35:30,574
What was happening
in Guadaloupe...

1072
01:35:30,713 --> 01:35:33,341
Their suffering
is like ours!

1073
01:35:33,482 --> 01:35:35,746
This deep-rooted misery,

1074
01:35:35,885 --> 01:35:38,285
in our guts.

1075
01:35:38,421 --> 01:35:40,719
Who among us
can tear it out?

1076
01:35:40,857 --> 01:35:42,825
How terrible it is!

1077
01:35:42,959 --> 01:35:44,893
The people cry famine.

1078
01:35:45,027 --> 01:35:47,928
Life has become
impossible...

1079
01:35:48,064 --> 01:35:50,589
in this land.

1080
01:35:50,733 --> 01:35:53,224
Yet life could be easy.

1081
01:35:53,369 --> 01:35:55,929
Money and justice...

1082
01:35:56,072 --> 01:36:00,771
are what's needed
to end our suffering.

1083
01:36:16,392 --> 01:36:18,383
She stopped breathing!

1084
01:36:18,527 --> 01:36:20,358
Go on and play outside.

1085
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:04,527
Ma Tine has gone
to Mr. Medouze's Africa.

1086
01:38:04,667 --> 01:38:08,501
Tomorrow, I'll return
to Fort-de-France,

1087
01:38:08,637 --> 01:38:10,264
and I'll take my

1088
01:38:10,406 --> 01:38:11,805
Black Shack Alley

1089
01:38:11,941 --> 01:38:13,067
with me.
